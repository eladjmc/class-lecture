The lecture I made for clean code and class explanation


## I was given a task @ AppleSeeds to preform a lecture about clean code concepts.
I made a few examples in a form of code and made a powerpoint presentation.

This repo contains the docs and code from the lecture, if you find this intresting feel free to fork/clone/download the content.
for any questions what so ever you can contact me.

# Enjoy
